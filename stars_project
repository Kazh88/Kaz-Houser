/* Based on the first 100 results, majority of stars are considered main-sequence stars, luminating one of these three colors: blue-white, yellow-white, or orange-red. 
Barnard's Star is the most common star on the list with a temperature of approximately 3,100 Kelvin and is considered an orange-red main-sequence star in
its spectral class (this star is the second closest star system to our Sun). On the other hand, Acrux is the rarest star on the list with the highest temperature 
of them all at about 28,000 Kelvin. This star is considered a blue-white subgiant in its spectral class. */
