/* Based on the first 100 results, majority of the stars are considered main-sequence stars, luminating one of these three
colors: blue-white, yellow-white, or orange-red. Alpha Centauri B is the most common star on the list with its
temperature being at approximately 3.9 Kelvin and is considered an orange main-sequence star in its spectral class (this star is
a part of the Alpha Centauri star system which is the nearest star system to our Sun). On the other hand, Deneb is the rarest
star on the list with the highest temperature out of all of them estimated at 2,600.5 Kelvin and is considered a blue-white 
supergiant. */
